MarkeTech Carbon Nanofoam,"Carbon, Ceramic, Aerogel","Electrically conductive carbon nanofoams possess many of the properties of traditional aerogel material. These materials are available in the form of monoliths, granules, powders and papers. They are synthetic, lightweight foams in which the solid matrix and pore spaces have nanometer-scale dimensions. Prepared by sol-gel methods, nanofoams typically have low density, continuous porosity, high surface area, and fine cell/pore sizes. The foams are also electrically conductive and have a high capacitance., Carbon nanofoams are being used as lightweight, high temperature insulation, absorbents and coatings, specialty optics, and electrodes for water deionization cells, fuel cells, and other devices. Morphology examination by scanning electron microscope shows an open cell structure and continuous porosity. The particle size and pore spacing is a function of density and the polymerization chemistry used during the sol-gel process. Low density carbon nanofoams (~0.25 g/cm3) have the largest cell/pore size with particle diameters of up to 100 nm and pores at least 500 nm.

Goodfellow Multi Wall Carbon Nanotube Powder (MWCNT),Carbon,"Multi Wall Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) powder is produced via Catalytic Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD). The carbon nanotubes are tube-shaped materials, exclusively composed of carbon atoms, having a nanometric diameter. The graphite layer can be visualized somewhat like a rolled-up wire with a continuous unbroken hexagonal mesh and carbon atoms at the apexes of the hexagons. With action of van der Waals forces, carbon nanotubes tend to cluster into bundles or agglomerates. Consequently, carbon nanotubes look like a black powder. At nanoscale, they have a spaghetti-like structure., Primary interest is in applications requiring low electrical percolation threshold such as high-performance electrostatic dissipative plastics or coatings. These carbon nanotubes are used in various applications in different markets:, Transportation (Automotive, Aeronautic, Boats), Electronics (Electronic packaging, EMI-shielding, sensors), Energy (Lithium-ion), Industrial applications (Oil&Gas, dynamic rubber parts, coatings, heating elements), Sporting goods, Benefits:, High electrical conductivity, Good processability, Retention of key mechanical properties, Cost effective, High recyclability in thermoplastics, Cleanliness, Flame retardancy (synergy in combination with other flame retardants), Thermal dissipation, UV resistance, Black tinting",N/A,,,"[{'Specific Surface Area': {'Metric': '250-300m²/g', 'English': '250-300m²/g', 'Comments': 'BET'}}]",N/A,N/A,"[{'Volume Resistivity': {'Metric': '0.00010ohm-cm', 'English': '0.00010ohm-cm', 'Comments': None}}]",N/A,N/A,"[{'Carbon, C': {'Component Elements Properties': '90 %', 'Metric': '90 %', 'English': 'Carbon Purity; TGA', 'Comments': None}}]",[{'Average Diameter9.5 nmTEM': {'Descriptive Properties': 'Average Length1.5 µmTEM'}}],,https://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=76cccf8a0e564c438fea4cb77aa16f52

Momentive Performance Materials TC1050 Encapsulated Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite (TPG),"Carbon, Graphite","GE Advanced Ceramics has developed a family of thermal materials based upon its high conductivity thermal pyrolytic graphite (TPG) material.  TPG is a unique form of pyrolytic graphite manufactured by the decomposition of a hydrocarbon gas in a high vacuum furnace. Referred to as TC1050, these macrocomposite materials offer both high conductivity, low density, and low thermal expansion properties.  TC1050 consists of a TPG core encapsulated within a structural shell. The TPG provides a highly conductive path while the encapsulation material provides the structure (strength, stiffness, and coefficient of thermal expansion). Chemical isolation and electrical insulation of the aluminum from the graphite resistive element for PBN/G evaporators permit electrical resistance stability and consistency throughout their long life.  This guarantees absolute flash-to-flash temperature repeatability, total aluminum evaporation and thickness (Q-value) consistency of the deposited layer.  Encapsulant materials include 6061 aluminum, OFHC copper, and graphite/polymer composites., Information provided by Momentive Performance Materials, formerly GE Advanced Ceramics.",N/A,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,[{'': {'Momentive Performance Materials TC1050 Encapsulated Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite (TPG)\n      \n      \n      \n    ': None}}],N/A,N/A,N/A,,https://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=46c0ea34de7c4a2b913b4f97e801c4c6
"Momentive Performance Materials ""PG"" Pyrolytic Graphite","Carbon, Graphite","Pyrolytic Graphite (PG) is a unique form of graphite manufactured by decomposition of a hydrocarbon gas at very high temperature in a vacuum furnace.  The result is an ultra-pure product which is near theoretical density and extremely anisotropic.  This anisotropy results from the layered structure.  As an example, PG exhibits a thermal conductivity consistent with the best conductors in the ""AB"" plane and lower than alumina brick in the ""C"" direction.  Mechanical thermal, and electrical properties are generally far superior to conventional graphites.  Typical properties are listed below.

Momentive Performance Materials Q-Coat™ Flash Evaporator,"Carbon, Graphite, Ceramic, Nitride","Patented Q-COAT™  FLASH EVAPORATORS represent a new generation of technology for the flash metallization market.  They are constructed by coating a graphite (G) resistive element with a layer of ultra high purity BORALLOY® pyrolytic boron nitride (PBN) and are engineered to be the most electrically consistent and chemically stable aluminum evaporators available.  Since PBN maintains its high electrical resistivity and resistance to corrosive attack by aluminum, even at extreme temperature, the aluminum remains completely isolated from the control circuit and the resulting power curve is amazingly stable and repeatable.  These PBN/Graphite (PBN/G) evaporators are also designed to directly substitute for ceramic evaporators in existing equipment., Performance Features, Ultra Pure, No Outgassing, Repeatable Power Curve, Very Long Life (Thousands of Flashes), Direct Substitute for Ceramic Elements, Less Down Time, Reduces Rework, Cost Effective, More Consistent Al Quality & Thickness, Chemical isolation and electrical insulation of the aluminum from the graphite resistive element for PBN/G evaporators permit electrical resistance stability and consistency throughout their long life.
