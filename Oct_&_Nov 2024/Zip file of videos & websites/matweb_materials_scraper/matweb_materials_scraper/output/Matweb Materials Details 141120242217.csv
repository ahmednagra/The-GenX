TIMCAL TIMREX® M100 mesh FR Natural Flake Graphite,"Carbon, Graphite, Other Engineering Material, Additive/Filler for Polymer","TIMREX Natural Flake Graphite is produced in a wide range of products distinguished by particle size distribution, chemistry and carbon content. Timcal mines the graphite from its own source in Lac-des-Îles, Quebec, Canada. Further processing can be done either in Lac-des-Îles or for high added value products (e.g. TIMREX  PG25) in our new processing plant in Terrebonne, Quebec, Canada. All TIMREX, “Naturals” are thoroughly controlled in our laboratories to ensure quality, consistency and total customer satisfaction., Advantages and applications: ,  Suitable for all organic bonded friction materials, especially for linings in drum brakes as well as in brake pads for trains.,  Good transfer film formation, Good thermal conductivity, Excellent lubricating properties,  Fe-self lubricating engineering parts,  Fe-friction parts, Copper/bronze bearings, Copper friction parts copper clutch facings , Information provided by TIMCAL",N/A,,,"[{'Bulk Density': {'Metric': '0.750g/cc', 'English': '0.0271lb/in³', 'Comments': 'Tap'}}]",N/A,N/A,N/A,"[{'Thermal Conductivity': {'Metric': '190W/m-K', 'English': '1320BTU-in/hr-ft²-°F', 'Comments': None}}]",N/A,"[{'H2O, Water': {'Component Elements Properties': '<= 0.50 %', 'Metric': '<= 0.50 %', 'English': 'Guaranteed', 'Comments': None}}]",[{'Crystallite height Lc>350 nm': {'Descriptive Properties': 'DBP absorption42 g/100g(Dibutylphthalate)'}}],,https://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=de8f56ab94ad4309ae73d0e2629f59b4
OCSiAl TUBALL™ MATRIX 602 Graphene Nanotube Concentrate,"Carbon, Other Engineering Material, Additive/Filler for Polymer","TUBALL™ MATRIX is a line of concentrates based on TUBALL™ graphene nanotubes (GNT) produced by OCSiAl. TUBALL™ MATRIX concentrates are available in several matrixes, are easy to handle, and can be processed using standard equipment. Depending on the TUBALL™ MATRIX percentage in the final compound and the processing conditions and other system components, the volume resistivity can be adjusted within the range  from 100 to 10, 8,  Ohm·cm.  TUBALL™ is a unique GNT additive that provides electrical conductivity at low dosages not achievable with any standard conductive additive. These low dosages enable the electrical resistivity of the material to be reduced with minimal impact on the host matrix, including retaining and even improving mechanical properties, minimally increasing density, and limiting the influence on the rheological properties and color., Benefits:  TUBALL™ GNT, carried by TUBALL™ MATRIX, enable ultra-low dosage of conductive filler starting from just 0.03 wt.% for anti-static, static dissipative and conductive applications, Allow production of conductive parts that retains bright colors, Ensure permanent and uniform electrical conductivity without “hot spots”, Maintain rheology of the uncured compound, Standard processing and mixing equipment, Improve mechanical properties and retain softness., Information provided by OCSiAl",N/A,,,"[{'Density': {'Metric': '1.02g/cc', 'English': '0.0368lb/in³', 'Comments': 'DN 51757'}}]",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,[{'AppearanceBlack paste': {'Descriptive Properties': 'CarrierVinyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane'}}],,https://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=994387dcf04a4acabc82789e70fff736
