BACT DLC Diamond-Like Coating,"Carbon, Diamond, Other Engineering Material, Ceramic/Metallic Coating","DLC (a-C:H).  This coating provides the highest hardness and abrasion resistance of the BACT products.  Typical applications include high wear environments involving seals, molds, metal forming, and powder compaction., Applied using a PACVD (plasma-assisted physical vapor deposition) coating method.  Diamond-like coatings are amorphous carbon-based coatings that exhibit high hardness and low coefficients of friction.  Their unique composition and structure result in excellent wear resistance and non-stick characteristics.  These coatings are thin, chemically inert, corrosion resistant, have minimal particulate contamination, tailorable electrical resistivities, and have a very low surface roughness., Information provided by Bekaert Advanced Coating Technologies (BACT).",N/A,,,"[{'Thickness': {'Metric': '0.100-4.00microns', 'English': '0.00394-0.157mil', 'Comments': 'Coating Thickness'}}]",N/A,"[{'Hardness, Rockwell C': {'Metric': '77 - 82', 'English': '77 - 82', 'Comments': None}}]","[{'Electrical Resistivity': {'Metric': '1.00e+6-1.00e+12ohm-cm', 'English': '1.00e+6-1.00e+12ohm-cm', 'Comments': None}}]","[{'Maximum Service Temperature, Air': {'Metric': '300°C', 'English': '572°F', 'Comments': None}}]",N/A,N/A,[{'Microhardness18 - 25 GPa': {'Descriptive Properties': 'Surface Energy40 - 50 mN/m'}}],,https://www.matweb.com/search/DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=39d0c1520f8649339b3ac98acc9fa8d5
